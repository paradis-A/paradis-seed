# Fluid and Frozen
RedBeanNode has two modes, **fluid** and **frozen**.
As you have seen in the previous chapters, RedBeanNode will keep changing the schema to fit your needs, this is what we call '**fluid mode**'.

While this is great for development you don't want this to happen on your production server. That's why you need to **freeze** the schema before you deploy your application. To freeze your app, put **R.freeze(true)** at the beginning of your script, like this:

```javascript
const { R } = require("redbean-node");
R.setup();
R.freeze(true);
// your code...
```

After freezing the schema, open your database client and inspect the schema RedBeanNode has created for you. You can now refine it where necessary, i.e. add some indexes, change some columns, add or change constraints and more.

> Always review the schema generated by RedBeanNode and allow yourself some time to refine it.
>
> Do not change the table or column names though, these are part of the RedBeanNode conventions. Instead, I recommend inspecting and refine column types ( maybe a bit too wide ? ), indexes and foreign key constraint settings.
