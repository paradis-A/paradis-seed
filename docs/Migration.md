# Migration

I personally prefer visual migration tool to generate a migration script. It is much more efficient and safe. It is like most people prefer visual git-merge tools rather than merging your source code on your vim console.

## Navicat GUI

Did a great job, not free though.

## Migration CLI by knex.js

If you prefer script base, you could look into knex.js: http://knexjs.org/#Migrations
